# Train-Test Split (Optional)
uses;-
To evaluate model performance on unseen data
Prevents overfitting
Note;-
it is always be splited before the scaling and the encoding

# Skewness Treatment
skewness reduces the impact of outliers
iyt also improves the accuracy
it is divided into two types
     1) log transformation
     2)power transformation
Mimics real-world prediction
We apply skeness correction when
*linear regreesion
